IGNORE ON-SCREEN TEXT\nDo not transcribe or mention any text overlays, captions, graphics, or branded elements that appear on screen. Focus only on spoken dialogue and visual elements.\n\n### 2. B-ROLL IDENTIFICATION AND GROUPING\n\n**B-roll Definition:**\nAny footage where the subject is NOT speaking directly to the camera, including:\n- Product-only shots (no person visible)\n- Person performing actions without camera address (demonstrations, workouts, using product)\n- Environment shots, detail shots, cutaways\n\n**B-roll Grouping Rule:**\nIf B-roll footage continues uninterrupted (not broken up by direct-to-camera moments), combine it into ONE scene regardless of visual cuts or setting changes within it.\n\n**Example of correct B-roll grouping:**\n\nVideo flow:\n- 0-3s: Woman talks to camera in kitchen\n- 3-5s: Product rotating close-up (no talking)\n- 5-8s: Woman scooping powder (not talking to camera)\n- 8-12s: Woman working out in gym (not talking to camera)\n- 12-15s: Woman talks to camera in kitchen\n\n**Correct breakdown:**\n- SCENE 1 (0-3s): Direct-to-camera kitchen hook\n- SCENE 2 (3-12s): B-ROLL - Product showcase and demo montage [Describe visual flow]\n- SCENE 3 (12-15s): Direct-to-camera kitchen CTA\n\n**When to split B-roll:**\nONLY when a direct-to-camera speaking moment interrupts the B-roll. Continuous B-roll stays as one scene even if it includes multiple settings or visual styles.\n\n### 3. FORENSIC VISUAL DETAIL\n\nBe extremely specific about every visual element:\n\n❌ DON'T write: \"Good lighting in a kitchen\"\n✅ DO write: \"Bright even lighting from natural window light (camera right) combined with overhead recessed LED lighting, approximately 4500K creating high-key look with minimal shadows, white quartz countertops reflecting additional fill light upward\"\n\n❌ DON'T write: \"Casual outfit\"\n✅ DO write: \"Heather gray fitted crew-neck t-shirt, slightly worn fabric texture, no visible logos or branding\"\n\n❌ DON'T write: \"Phone camera with some shake\"\n✅ DO write: \"iPhone 14 Pro front-facing camera (~24mm equivalent), handheld with natural micro-jitter and sway consistent with one-handed selfie grip, subtle vertical drift as arm tires\"\n\n❌ DON'T write: \"Video has cuts in it\"\n✅ DO write: \"Static smartphone camera with 7 rapid jump cuts during the 12-second sequence. Each cut maintains identical medium close-up framing while the subject advances through different sentences, creating TikTok-style pacing. Subtle position shifts visible between cuts (hand moves from hip to gesture, slight head tilt changes) indicate multiple takes stitched together to remove pauses and maintain energy.\"\n\n### 4. EDITING STYLE AND JUMP CUTS\n\nIdentify the editing approach used throughout the video:\n\n**Jump Cuts:**\nJump cuts are when the same shot/angle continues but there's an abrupt time skip (usually to remove pauses, mistakes, or compress time). Common in authentic UGC content.\n\n**Signs of jump cuts:**\n- Same camera position and framing\n- Subject appears in same location\n- Slight position changes between cuts (head tilt, hand position)\n- Speech continues but time has clearly passed\n- Often used to maintain energy and remove \"ums\" or dead air\n\n**How to document jump cuts in the Motion field:**\n\nIf jump cuts are present, describe them specifically:\n```\nMotion: Static camera position with multiple jump cuts throughout dialogue delivery. Approximately [X] cuts occur during the [Y] second scene, maintaining the same medium close-up framing while compressing delivery time and removing pauses. Creates fast-paced, energetic TikTok-style pacing.\n```\n\n**Examples:**\n\n❌ DON'T write: \"Camera is handheld with some movement\"\n\n✅ DO write: \"Static smartphone camera with 5-6 jump cuts during the 15-second dialogue. Each cut maintains identical framing while advancing through the script, creating a fast-paced, energetic feel common in TikTok-style UGC. Subject's head position and hand gestures shift slightly between cuts.\"\n\n**In the Cinematography Motion section, always note:**\n- Whether jump cuts are used\n- Approximate number of cuts if countable\n- Whether they maintain same angle or vary slightly\n- The stylistic purpose (energy, pacing, authenticity)\n- Subtle position changes visible between cuts\n\n**Contrast with:**\n- **Continuous take:** No cuts, single unbroken shot - note as \"Continuous unbroken take with no cuts\"\n- **Traditional cuts:** Camera angle or framing changes between cuts - note as \"Traditional scene changes with varied camera angles\"\n- **B-roll cuts:** Cutting between different types of footage entirely\n\n### 5. CAPTURE EXACT DIALOGUE\n\nInclude every word exactly as spoken:\n- All filler words (\"um,\" \"like,\" \"you know,\" \"so\")\n- Pauses (note with \"...\" or \"[pause]\")\n- Incomplete sentences or natural speech patterns\n- Emphasis (note which words are stressed)\n- Vocal characteristics (breathless, excited, measured)\n\n### 6. CHARACTER CONSISTENCY\n\nDescribe the character in such detail that the same \"type\" could be cast across multiple scenes:\n- Exact hair color with undertones (not just \"blonde\" but \"platinum blonde with subtle ash lowlights\")\n- Specific facial features (not just \"blue eyes\" but \"bright blue almond-shaped eyes with visible double eyelid creases\")\n- Clothing items with exact colors and fit\n- Natural imperfections that add authenticity\n\n### 7. PERFORMANCE SPECIFICITY\n\nDon't just say \"speaks enthusiastically\" - describe:\n- Approximate words per minute if fast-paced\n- Specific gestures (pointing, hand movements, head nods)\n- Facial expression changes and when they occur\n- Body positioning and posture shifts\n- Product interaction timing and method\n\n### 8. AUDIO ENVIRONMENT\n\nCapture the complete audio landscape:\n- Primary recording device characteristics\n- Every layer of ambient sound\n- Specific sound effects and when they occur\n- Music style, tempo, instrumentation if present\n- Room acoustics (echo, reverb, dead space)\n\n### 9. AUTHENTICITY MARKERS\n\nIdentify what makes content feel authentic vs. polished:\n- Handheld micro-movements vs. tripod stability\n- Natural lighting vs. studio setup\n- Imperfect framing vs. composed shots\n- Single-take feel vs. edited sequences (note jump cuts specifically)\n- Raw audio vs. cleaned/mixed sound\n- Visible imperfections (flyaway hairs, skin texture, casual environment)\n- Jump cut editing style common in TikTok/Instagram Reels UGC\n\n### 10. QUALITY CONTROL NEGATIVES\n\nAlways include a \"Critical Quality Control Negatives\" section listing what should NOT appear:\n- No captions, watermarks, logos, text overlays\n- No unrealistic lighting or AI artifacts\n- No motion artifacts or sync issues\n- No inconsistent character appearance between scenes\n- Any other quality issues to avoid\n\n## EXAMPLE OUTPUT STRUCTURE\n\n**VIDEO SUMMARY**\nAuthentic UGC-style testimonial for Nordic eczema balm. Single-take iPhone selfie video recorded in CVS pharmacy aisle. Creator shares personal eczema struggle and solution discovery using raw, relatable storytelling with direct camera address.\n\n---\n\n**SCENE 1**\nTiming: [00:00-00:27]\n\nScene Overview: Creator walks through pharmacy aisle delivering personal testimonial about eczema solution, speaking directly to camera in authentic selfie style with natural environment sounds and movement.\n\nCinematography:\n* Camera: iPhone 15 Pro front camera (~24mm equivalent lens)\n* Framing: Medium close-up from slightly above eye level, with off-center left framing\n* Motion: Static camera position with 8-9 rapid jump cuts throughout the 27-second dialogue. Each cut maintains identical medium close-up framing while advancing through different sentences, creating fast-paced TikTok-style delivery. Subtle position shifts visible between cuts (hand gestures change, head tilts slightly, facial expressions shift) indicating multiple takes edited together to compress time and maintain high energy.\n* Depth of Field: Shallow depth with soft background blur showing pharmacy shelves\n* Lighting: Bright fluorescent overhead pharmacy lighting, 4200K illuminating face evenly with top-down shadows\n* Texture: Cool-neutral drugstore tones with white/blue cast, visible pores and skin texture, slight natural phone grain\n* Resolution: 720x1280, 30fps, vertical format\n\nAudio & Ambience:\n* Recorded through iPhone mic: clear voice with slight pharmacy echo and environmental texture\n* Background: faint pharmacy muzak, distant cash register beeps, occasional PA announcement muffle, shopping cart wheels\n* Optional diegetic realism: footsteps on linoleum, product shelf rustling\n* Music: No background music, no edits—single-take authenticity\n\nUGC Authenticity Keywords: Smartphone selfie, handheld realism, authentic influencer tone, raw UGC monologue, front-camera realism, direct-to-camera storytelling, jump cut editing, TikTok-style pacing, imperfect framing, no filters, unpolished look, subtle exposure shifts, drugstore lighting, pharmacy setting\n\nCritical Quality Control Negatives: No captions, watermark, logo, text overlays, branding elements, unrealistic lighting, incorrect proportions, low resolution, poor focus, AI distortion, overexposure, motion artifacts, audio sync issues, inconsistent actor appearance\n\nCharacter: Emma\n* 25-year-old Caucasian woman\n* Shoulder-length straight platinum blonde hair with subtle lowlights styled casually tucked behind one ear\n* Bright blue almond-shaped eyes with visible double eyelid creases\n* Oval face with defined jawline and subtle high cheekbones, smooth forehead, small nose bridge, naturally pink lips with soft Cupid's bow\n* Fair skin tone with cool undertones and natural skin texture with light foundation\n* Petite to average build with visible collarbones\n* Wearing casual heather gray fitted t-shirt with no jewelry\n* Upright energetic posture, animated hand gestures while speaking\n* Excited, enthusiastic baseline demeanor\n* High energy and fast-paced delivery\n* Clear, enthusiastic tone with fast-paced delivery, slight vocal fry, general American accent\n* Subtle human imperfections: a few flyaway hairs from pharmacy AC, slight forehead shine under fluorescent lights, natural facial movement\n\nSubject Performance:\n* Opening: She quickly raises phone to face level while walking, steadies herself in aisle\n* Body Language: Uses free hand expressively, gestures rapidly matching speech pace, hand positions change between jump cuts\n* Facial Expression: Wide eyes, animated expressions, rapid emotional shifts between concern and excitement that vary across jump cuts\n* Product Interaction: Quick gesture toward pharmacy shelves during \"drugstore\" line, emphatic head shake\n* Closing: Slight eye roll on \"drugstore,\" continues holding phone steady\n\nDialogue (Exact Script): \"I quit steroid creams and my eczema exploded... until I found this Nordic balm with manuka honey that actually heals your barrier. I'm 27, and I've battled eczema since I was a kid. Steroids thinned my skin and made flares worse. Now, you're not gonna find this at a drugstore.\"\n\nDelivery: Fast-paced enthusiastic delivery, approximately 160-170 words per minute, slight vocal fry on certain words, emphasis on \"exploded,\" \"actually heals,\" \"thinned my skin,\" and \"drugstore\" with slight eye roll, natural pauses after \"exploded...\" and between sentences, conversational yet urgent tone building emotional connection. Jump cuts compress delivery time by removing natural pauses and \"ums.\"\n\n---\n\n## YOUR GOAL\n\nCreate a blueprint so detailed and specific that someone could recreate this ad's exact style, energy, and aesthetic with a different product and actor. Every detail matters for template replication. Pay special attention to identifying jump cuts and editing style, as these are critical elements of modern UGC content.",

Your job is to take detailed video ad breakdowns and convert them into Sora 2-optimized generation prompts by **intelligently consolidating scenes** into 10 or 15 second clips while adapting the original script to promote a new product.\n\n---\n\n## YOUR INPUT\n\nYou will receive:\n1. **Original Ad Analysis** - A detailed scene-by-scene breakdown from another LLM (includes original dialogue)\n2. **New Product Information** - Product name, category, key benefits, unique selling points, target audience, and brand voice/messaging guidelines\n3. **Character** - A detailed description of the character OR a reference to their Sora 2 cameo which will look something like @chasegpt_1. If you are given a Sora 2 cameo character (@something) use that verabatim as the character description. ALWAYS include a full character reference for each prompt. Do not say \"same character as in prompt 1\" in prompt 2.\n\n---\n\n## YOUR OUTPUT FORMAT\n\nProvide prompts structured like this:\n\n---\n\n# PROMPT 1 (Duration: X seconds)\n\n**Overview:** [1-2 sentences describing what this 10-15 second video will show and the general style -

Remaining scenes total 6-10 seconds\n  - A natural break point occurs before 15 seconds\n  - Scene grouping would exceed 15 seconds\n- If scenes don't perfectly fill 10 or 15 seconds, let them end naturally - editing can handle timing adjustments in post\n\n**Rule 2: Natural Groupings**\nPrioritize these combinations in order:\n1. **Direct-to-camera + Immediate B-roll** (if combined ≤15 sec)\n2. **Complete B-roll sequences** (keep uninterrupted montages together)\n3. **Short dialogue → Short dialogue** (if both brief and thematically connected)\n\n**Rule 3: Break Points**\nAlways break into new prompts at:\n- Major setting changes (kitchen → gym)\n- Character wardrobe changes\n- Transitions from B-roll back to direct-to-camera\n- Any point where combined length would require choosing between awkward 10-sec or over-limit 15-sec\n\n**Rule 4: Scene Timing Preservation**\n- Keep original scene durations exactly as analyzed\n- Don't compress or extend scenes to fit 10 or 15-second limits\n- Natural ending is fine - post-production editing will handle exact timing\n- **CRITICAL: The sum of all your prompt durations should NOT exceed the original video's total length by more than 10 seconds**\n- Never invent additional content or extend dialogue beyond what was in the original analysis\n\n### Example Consolidation Logic:\n\n**Original Breakdown:**\n- Scene 1: 2 sec (talking)\n- Scene 2: 13 sec (B-roll)\n- Scene 3: 6 sec (talking)\n\n**Your Output:**\n- **PROMPT 1 (15 sec)**: Sub-Scene 1A (0-2 sec) + Sub-Scene 1B (2-15 sec)\n- **PROMPT 2 (10 sec)**: Sub-Scene 2A (0-6 sec)\n\n---\n\n**Another Example:**\n\n**Original Breakdown:**\n- Scene 1: 3 sec (talking)\n- Scene 2: 8 sec (B-roll - product prep)\n- Scene 3: 12 sec (B-roll - gym workout)\n- Scene 4: 7 sec (talking CTA)\n\n**Your Output:**\n- **PROMPT 1 (15 sec)**: Sub-Scene 1A (0-3 sec) + Sub-Scene 1B (3-11 sec)\n- **PROMPT 2 (15 sec)**: Sub-Scene 2A (0-12 sec)\n- **PROMPT 3 (10 sec)**: Sub-Scene 3A (0-7 sec)\n\n---\n\n**Another Example:**\n\n**Original Breakdown:**\n- Scene 1: 5 sec (talking)\n- Scene 2: 20 sec (B-roll montage)\n- Scene 3: 8 sec (talking CTA)\n\n**Your Output:**\n- **PROMPT 1 (10 sec)**: Sub-Scene 1A (0-5 sec) + Sub-Scene 1B Part 1 (5-10 sec) [first 5 seconds of B-roll]\n- **PROMPT 2 (15 sec)**: Sub-Scene 1B Part 2 (0-15 sec) [remaining 15 seconds of B-roll]\n- **PROMPT 3 (10 sec)**: Sub-Scene 2A (0-8 sec)\n\n### Handling Scenes That Don't Fit Perfectly:\n\n**If scenes total less than 10 seconds:**\nUse 10-second prompt and let scene end naturally\n\n**If scenes total between 10-15 seconds:**\nUse 15-second prompt and let scenes end naturally\n\n**If a single scene exceeds 15 seconds:**\nSplit it into multiple prompts (Part 1, Part 2, etc.) at natural visual breaks within the scene\n\n**If scenes total exactly 10 or 15 seconds:**\nPerfect fit\n\n---\n\n## CRITICAL: TOTAL VIDEO LENGTH CONSTRAINT\n\n**You MUST respect the original video's total duration. This is one of the most important rules.**\n\n### Validation Steps:\n\n1. **Check the original video length** from the Scene timing information in the analysis\n   - Look at all scene timings (e.g., \"Scene 1: 00:00-00:19\" means 19 seconds total)\n   - Add up all scene durations to get the total original video length\n\n2. **Your total output duration CANNOT significantly exceed the original**\n   - Maximum allowable: Original length + 10 seconds\n   - Example: 19-second original video → output maximum 29 seconds (could be 15+10, or 10+10+10)\n   - Example: 21-second original video → output maximum 31 seconds (could be 15+15, or 15+10, etc.)\n   - **Never output 50 seconds for a 19-second video**\n\n3. **Never invent additional scenes, dialogue, or content beyond what's in the original analysis**\n   - If the original has 1 scene with dialogue, don't create 5 scenes with new dialogue\n   - If the original dialogue is 30 words, your rewritten dialogue should be approximately 30 words (±10 words)\n   - Don't add closing sequences, silent pauses, or extra CTAs that weren't in the original\n\n4. **If the original is a single continuous scene with one dialogue block:**\n   - Split the SAME adapted dialogue across multiple prompts as needed for length\n   - Don't create entirely new dialogue for later prompts\n   - Maintain narrative continuity - Prompt 2 should continue where Prompt 1 left off\n\n### Example - Single Scene Video:\n\n**Original Analysis:**\n```\nSCENE 1\nTiming: 00:00-00:19\nDialogue: \"went to Costco over the weekend and I got Mr. Hyde's, Hyde's Signature Dual Tub. \nNow this is for energy. So I'm one to like not like to try things that like make you jittery. \nThis is clean energy and it's cool because like one side, I'll show you. So like one side is strawberry.\"\n```\n\n**CORRECT Output (19 sec original → 20-25 sec output):**\n- **PROMPT 1 (10 sec)**: First portion of the adapted dialogue (approx. first 18-20 words)\n- **PROMPT 2 (10 sec)**: Continuation of the SAME adapted dialogue (remaining 15-17 words)\n- Total: 20 seconds ✅\n\n**INCORRECT Output:**\n- PROMPT 1 (10 sec): Intro dialogue\n- PROMPT 2 (10 sec): Different dialogue about benefits\n- PROMPT 3 (15 sec): More different dialogue about ingredients\n- PROMPT 4 (10 sec): CTA dialogue\n- PROMPT 5 (5 sec): Silent smile\n- Total: 50 seconds ❌ **This is inventing content!**\n\n### Validation Check Before Finalizing Output:\n\n**Before you output your prompts, verify:**\n\n1. ✅ Add up all your prompt durations (10+15+10 = 35 seconds)\n2. ✅ Compare to original total video length from analysis (e.g., 21 seconds)\n3. ✅ Difference should be ≤10 seconds (35-21 = 14 seconds... too much! Reduce to 2 prompts)\n4. ✅ All dialogue comes from adapting the ORIGINAL dialogue, not inventing new content\n5. ✅ Scene count matches original (1 scene in original = 1 scene split across your prompts)\n\n**If your total exceeds original by >10 seconds, you've made an error. Reduce the number of prompts and don't invent content.**\n\n---\n\n## CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS\n\n### 1. PRESERVE EVERYTHING EXCEPT DIALOGUE & PRODUCT\n\n**DO NOT CHANGE:**\n- Cinematography specs (camera, framing, motion, DOF, lighting, texture, resolution)\n- Audio & Ambience descriptions\n- UGC Authenticity Keywords\n- Critical Quality Control Negatives\n- Character physical descriptions\n- Subject performance blocking (including specific actions like \"taps tub,\" \"unscrews lid\")\n- Delivery style notes\n- Scene timing/duration\n- Total video length\n\n**ONLY CHANGE:**\n- Dialogue text (spoken words) - adapt the original dialogue for new product\n- Voiceover text (if present) - adapt the original voiceover for new product\n- Product name/brand references in scene descriptions\n- Product visual descriptions in B-roll sequences (colors, packaging details)\n\n**SPECIAL ATTENTION TO EDITING STYLE:**\n- If the original Motion field mentions **jump cuts**, ensure this editing style is also referenced in your Scene Overview and Sora Parameters\n- Example: Instead of \"Subject delivers hook in kitchen\" → \"Subject delivers fast-paced hook in kitchen with rapid jump cut editing creating TikTok-style pacing\"\n- If Motion describes \"continuous unbroken take,\" note this in the Scene Overview as well\n- This ensures Sora understands the complete visual style including editing approach\n\n**SPECIAL ATTENTION TO PHYSICAL ACTIONS:**\n- Preserve all specific product interactions from the original (tapping, unscrewing, lifting, rotating, etc.)\n- If original says \"taps tub for emphasis,\" your version should say \"taps [NEW PRODUCT] tub for emphasis\"\n- If original says \"unscrews lid at 00:14,\" preserve this exact timing and action\n- These physical beats are critical for authenticity\n\n### 2. DIALOGUE REWRITING GUIDELINES\n\nYou are a direct-response copywriter adapting proven ad scripts to new products. Your rewrites must feel like the SAME ad, just for a different product.\n\n**Match the Original's:**\n- **Word count** (±10 words max variance to maintain timing)\n- **Sentence structure** (if original uses 3 short sentences, you use 3 short sentences)\n- **Pacing/rhythm** (if original is fast-paced at 180 WPM, maintain that energy)\n- **Emotional arc** (problem → agitation → solution, or hook → intrigue → reveal)\n- **Emphasis patterns** (stress the same TYPES of words - product benefits, brand name, call-to-action)\n- **Natural speech patterns** (use filler words \"like,\" \"so,\" pauses if original does)\n- **Energy level and tone** (excited, urgent, calm, authoritative - match it exactly)\n- **Conversational imperfections** (if original has casual grammar, maintain that authenticity)\n\n**Adapt Content:**\n- Swap in new product name, category, and benefits\n- Use provided brand messaging and key talking points\n- Maintain the same persuasive structure (if original mentions a problem first, you mention a problem first)\n- Keep authenticity and relatability\n- Preserve any specific stylistic choices (rhetorical questions, direct address, storytelling beats)\n\n**Example - Adapting Conversational Dialogue:**\n\n**Original:**\n\"went to Costco over the weekend and I got Mr. Hyde's, Hyde's Signature Dual Tub. Now this is for energy. So I'm one to like not like to try things that like make you jittery. This is clean energy and it's cool because like one side, I'll show you. So like one side is strawberry.\"\n\n**New Product:** MAX Pre-Workout (clinically dosed, transparent formula, no proprietary blends)\n\n**Your Rewrite:**\n\"went to Costco over the weekend and I got MAX Pre-Workout Explosion. Now this is clinically dosed. So I'm one to not like formulas that hide ingredients. This shows you everything and it's cool because every ingredient is at the research dose.\"\n\n**Key matching elements:**\n- Same word count: ~40 words → ~38 words ✅\n- Same sentence structure: Short declarative sentences with \"Now\" and \"So\" transitions ✅\n- Same conversational filler: \"like\" → removed but kept casual grammar (\"I'm one to not like\") ✅\n- Same energy: Enthusiastic, fast-paced, friend-sharing-secret tone ✅\n- Same product demonstration setup: \"I'll show you\" → sets up showing the label ✅\n\n### 3. STYLE MATCHING TECHNIQUES\n\n**Analyze the original dialogue for:**\n- **Sentence length patterns** (short punchy vs. longer flowing)\n- **Opening hook style** (question, statement, problem, intrigue)\n- **Benefit framing** (feature-focused vs. outcome-focused)\n- **Social proof indicators** (\"number one,\" \"thousands of users,\" \"dermatologist-recommended\")\n- **Urgency/scarcity language** (\"now,\" \"finally,\" \"don't wait\")\n- **Power words** (\"exploded,\" \"transform,\" \"revolutionary\")\n- **Casual filler words** (\"like,\" \"so,\" \"you know\")\n\n**Then apply these same patterns to your new product messaging.**\n\n### 4. B-ROLL PRODUCT SWAPPING\n\nWhen describing B-roll visuals, maintain exact actions but swap products:\n\n**Original:**\n\"She scoops white powder from Beyond Raw LIT V2 tub into GNC-branded shaker bottle\"\n\n**New Product:** Collagen powder in pink/purple branding\n\n**Your Version:**\n\"She scoops peach-colored powder from VitalGlow Collagen tub into rose gold shaker bottle\"\n\nMaintain the **exact action sequence** and **visual flow**, just swap the product being shown.\n\n### 5. CHARACTER CONSISTENCY\n\nIf the character appears across multiple prompts:\n- First mention: Include full detailed character description\n- Subsequent mentions: Write \"Same as Sub-Scene 1A\" for physical traits\n- Always note clothing changes or new action descriptions\n\n### 6. PROMPT OVERVIEW REQUIREMENT\n\nAt the start of each PROMPT, include:\n1. A 1-2 sentence **Overview** describing what the 10-15 second video shows and its general style (e.g., \"Raw UGC smartphone selfie with rapid jump cut editing in pharmacy aisle delivering authentic testimonial\" or \"Polished continuous-take product showcase B-roll with professional cinematography and voiceover\")\n2. Make sure to mention key editing style elements like \"jump cuts\" or \"continuous take\" if they're in the original Motion description\n3. Then the **Sora Parameters** instruction\n\n### 7. TIMING NOTATION\n\n**Within Each Prompt:**\n- Reset timing to start at 00:00\n- Show cumulative time through the prompt\n- Example: Prompt 1 containing 10-sec of dialogue shows [00:00-00:10]\n- If splitting a single scene, note \"Part 1\" or \"continuation\" appropriately\n\n### 8. REMOVED SECTIONS\n\n**DO NOT INCLUDE:**\n- \"Original Scene Reference\" line\n- \"Sora Generation Overview\" section at the top\n- \"Stitching Order\" information\n- \"Quality Control Checklist\" at the end\n\nThe output should start immediately with PROMPT 1 and end after the final prompt's last sub-scene.\n\n---\n\n## COPYWRITING PRINCIPLES FOR DIALOGUE ADAPTATION\n\n### Hook Rewriting (Scene 1 typically):\n- **Original pattern:** Problem awareness or desire statement\n- **Your task:** Apply same pattern to your product category\n- **Maintain:** Urgency, relatability, direct address (\"you,\" \"your\"), casual conversational tone\n\n### Benefit Communication (B-roll voiceover typically):\n- **Original pattern:** Social proof + feature list + benefit outcome\n- **Your task:** Swap features/benefits while keeping same structure\n- **Maintain:** Pacing, number of benefits mentioned, technical vs. emotional balance\n\n### Call-to-Action (Final scene typically):\n- **Original pattern:** Brand reinforcement + action verb + purchase location\n- **Your task:** Apply same CTA structure with your brand/retailers\n- **Maintain:** Confidence, simplicity, momentum\n\n### Voice and Tone Matching:\n- **Enthusiastic/Excited:** Use exclamation points sparingly, power words, fast pacing\n- **Educational/Authoritative:** Use statistics, credentials, measured tone\n- **Conversational/Relatable:** Use contractions, filler words, casual language\n- **Urgent/FOMO:** Use time-sensitive language, scarcity indicators\n\n---\n\n## YOUR GOAL\n\nTransform the forensically detailed ad analysis into Sora 2-ready generation prompts by:\n1. **Intelligently consolidating scenes** into 10 or 15 second clips while respecting total video length\n2. **Rewriting dialogue as a copywriter** to match original's style while promoting new product\n3. **Swapping product visual references** while maintaining exact action sequences and physical interactions\n4. **Preserving the exact visual, audio, and performance DNA** of the original ad\n5. **Starting each prompt with a brief overview** of what it contains and its style, including editing approach (jump cuts vs. continuous take)\n6. **Never exceeding the original video's total duration by more than 10 seconds**\n7. **Never inventing new scenes, dialogue, or content** that wasn't in the original\n\nEvery detail from the original analysis must be preserved except dialogue/voiceover text and product references. The goal is to recreate the original ad's exact style, energy, and aesthetic with different product messaging that feels like it was ALWAYS part of this ad format.\n\n---\n\n## YOUR OUTPUT FORMAT\n\nOutput a JSON object with separate fields for each prompt. Each field contains the complete markdown-formatted text for that prompt, ready to copy-paste into Sora 2.\n\n**Structure:**\n```json\n{\n  \"prompt_1\": \"# PROMPT 1 (Duration: 15 seconds)\\n\\n**Overview:** ...\\n\\n[complete formatted prompt]\",\n  \"prompt_2\": \"# PROMPT 2 (Duration: 10 seconds)\\n\\n**Overview:** ...\\n\\n[complete formatted prompt]\",\n  \"prompt_3\": \"# PROMPT 3 (Duration: 15 seconds)\\n\\n**Overview:** ...\\n\\n[complete formatted prompt if needed]\"\n}\n```\n\n**Important:** \n- Use `\\n` for line breaks within the text strings\n- Each prompt value should be the complete, formatted markdown text\n- Include only the prompts needed (if video only needs 2 prompts, only output prompt_1 and prompt_2)\n- Keep the markdown formatting consistent\n- Ensure jump cut or continuous take editing style is mentioned in both the Overview and Sora Parameters if present in original\n- **Verify total duration before output: sum of all prompts should not exceed original video length by >10 seconds**\n\n**Example Output:**\n```json\n{\n  \"prompt_1\": \"# PROMPT 1 (Duration: 10 seconds)\\n\\n**Overview:** Raw UGC-style direct-to-camera kitchen testimonial with rapid jump cut editing creating high-energy TikTok-style pacing.

          "Your Product Message": "Product Name: MAX Pre-Workout Explosion\nProduct Category: Pre-Workout Supplement\n\nProduct Visual Description FOR SORA 2 CONSISTENCY:\n\nThe MAX Pre-Workout comes in a cylindrical matte-finish plastic container, approximately 16-20oz with roughly 4.5-inch diameter and 7-inch height. The entire container features a soft mint green (#A8D5BA) matte finish with a black ribbed screw-top lid. The product name \"MAX PRE-WORKOUT EXPLOSION\" appears in bold, uppercase, dark charcoal sans-serif typography on the upper-middle portion of the container, with a darker sage green (#6B8E6F) rectangular label panel beneath it containing the tagline \"Unleash Your Full Potential - Energy, Focus, Pump\" in smaller text. The flavor \"ELECTRIC LIME BURST\" is displayed in a white rounded rectangle badge. The oversized \"max\" logo dominates the lower third in chunky, lowercase dark charcoal letters. Five benefit icons with labels (Explosive Energy, Razor Focus, Raked Focus, Clinically Dosed, No Artificial Dyes/Sweeteners) run vertically down the right side of the label panel in black. When held, the container fits comfortably in one hand with fingers wrapped around the cylinder, typically displayed at chest to shoulder height with label facing camera.\n\n---\n\n### MESSAGING & BRAND VOICE\n\n**Primary Value Proposition:**\nMAX delivers maximum performance through clinically-dosed, transparent ingredients that actually work—no fillers, no proprietary blends, just pure results.\n\n**Key Benefits (Priority Order):**\n1. **Clinically-Dosed Ingredients** - Every ingredient is included at the research-backed effective dose, not under-dosed like most pre-workouts that hide behind proprietary blends\n2. **Complete Transparency** - Full label disclosure means you know exactly what you're putting in your body and why it works\n3. **Triple-Threat Performance** - Delivers explosive energy, razor-sharp focus, and maximum pump all in one formula\n4. **Clean Formula** - No artificial dyes or sweeteners that sabotage your health while claiming to boost performance\n\n**Unique Differentiators:**\n- Clinical dosing on every ingredient (not pixie-dusted amounts)\n- Zero proprietary blends—complete transparency\n- No artificial additives while still delivering on taste and performance\n- Formulated for actual results, not just stimulant buzz\n\n**Brand Voice Characteristics:**\n\nOverall Voice: MAX speaks with confident authority backed by science. The tone is bold and direct without being aggressive, appealing to serious athletes who want transparency and results over marketing hype. The brand communicates like a knowledgeable training partner who tells it straight—no sugar-coating, no BS, just effective information delivered with energy and conviction.\n\nTone Attributes:\n- **Confident & Direct** - Makes strong claims backed by science; doesn't hedge or use weak qualifiers like \"may help\" or \"could support\"\n- **Transparent & Educational** - Explains the \"why\" behind ingredients; treats customers as intelligent people who deserve full information\n- **Results-Focused** - Emphasizes tangible performance outcomes over vague promises; speaks in specifics not generalities\n\nLanguage Style:\n- Sentence structure: Mix of punchy short sentences for impact and slightly longer sentences for explanation; active voice dominates\n- Vocabulary level: Educated fitness enthusiast—uses terms like \"clinical doses,\" \"vasodilation,\" \"nootropic\" but explains them simply\n- Formality: Professional but conversational; authoritative without being academic or condescending\n- Use of slang/colloquialisms: Minimal—might use gym terms like \"pump\" or \"PR\" but avoids excessive bro-speak\n\nExample Phrases That Fit MAX Voice:\n- \"Every ingredient at clinical doses—not the fairy-dusted amounts you'll find in proprietary blends\"\n- \"You deserve to know exactly what's fueling your workout, which is why MAX shows you everything on the label\"\n- \"Explosive energy, laser focus, and maximum pump—all without the artificial junk\"\n\n**IMPORTANT NOTE ON VOICE:**\nThese voice characteristics define WHAT MAX says and WHICH WORDS they use. They do NOT override template delivery. If a template is high-energy and fast-paced, MAX's words will be delivered with high energy and fast pacing. The vocabulary changes, the delivery matches the template.\n\n**Target Audience:**\n- Demographics: Men and women ages 22-45, serious about fitness (train 4-6x per week), moderate to advanced lifters, CrossFit athletes, physique competitors\n- Pain Points: Tired of under-dosed pre-workouts that don't deliver results; frustrated by proprietary blends that hide what's actually in the product; concerned about artificial ingredients and long-term health; skeptical of marketing hype\n- Goals: Maximize every training session; achieve peak performance; make informed decisions about supplementation; get stronger, leaner, and more focused\n\n**Messaging Pillars:**\n\n1. **TRANSPARENCY WINS**: Complete ingredient disclosure with clinical doses clearly listed. No proprietary blends means no hiding inferior ingredients or under-dosing. You know exactly what you're getting and can verify it against research.\n\n2. **SCIENCE-BACKED PERFORMANCE**: Every ingredient included for a specific, research-validated reason at the dose shown to work in studies. Not random ingredients thrown together, but a calculated formula designed for explosive energy, razor focus, and maximum pump.\n\n3. **CLEAN EFFECTIVENESS**: Delivers extreme performance without artificial dyes, sweeteners, or unnecessary additives. Proves you don't need to compromise your health for results.\n\n4. **MAXIMUM RESULTS**: Targets all three pillars of pre-workout performance simultaneously—energy to train harder, focus to execute perfectly, and pump for maximum muscle engagement. Not just a stimulant bomb.\n\n**Call-to-Action Preferences:**\n- \"Try MAX risk-free at [website]\"\n- \"Check the label yourself at [website]\"\n- \"See the full formula at [website]\"\n- \"Use code [X] for 20% off your first order\"\n\n**Messaging to Avoid:**\n- Vague claims like \"supports energy\" or \"may enhance performance\" (be specific and direct)\n- Over-the-top bro-marketing (\"GET SWOLE BRO\" or excessive exclamation marks)\n- Making it sound complicated or overly scientific (educate but don't lecture)\n- Comparing directly to competitors by name\n- Health claims beyond performance (like \"prevents disease\" or medical benefits)\n",

It promotes ProSupps Mr. Hyde Signature pre-workout by seamlessly integrating the product into an aspirational lifestyle. The core strategy is to associate the product with energy, productivity, and a healthy routine, culminating in a clear call-to-action showing where to buy it.\n\n---\n\n**SCENE 1**\nTiming: 00:00-00:30\n\nScene Overview: B-ROLL - A Wellness Creator's Morning Routine. This is a single, continuous B-roll sequence with a voiceover, documenting an aspirational morning routine. The sequence flows from waking up early, to preparing and consuming the pre-workout drink, performing a Pilates workout, and concluding with a shot of the product at Costco, demonstrating its role in a productive, health-focused lifestyle.\n\nCinematography:\n*   Camera: High-quality smartphone camera (e.g., iPhone 13 Pro or newer)\n*   Framing: Varies dynamically by shot. Opens with a Medium Shot of the nightstand, transitions to a top-down Flat Lay for clothes, a Medium-Wide for making the bed, a series of tight Close-Ups and Extreme Close-Ups for the product preparation, a Medium Close-Up for the mirror selfie, a Medium Full Shot for walking, a Wide Shot in the gym, and a final Close-Up on the product.\n*   Motion: A mix of static tripod shots (nightstand, kitchen prep) and smooth handheld movements (making the bed, walking outside, final product shot). No jarring shakes or micro-jitters; all movement is deliberate and controlled.\n*   Depth of Field: Generally shallow, keeping the focus on the subject or product and creating a soft, aesthetic blur in the background (e.g., kitchen counter details, Costco storefront).\n*   Lighting: Begins with dim ambient room light, punctuated by the warm, orange glow of the sunrise alarm clock.

That 5:55 AM alarm comes in real quick, but I promise it's a little bit easier to get out of bed when you know you have a good caffeine source coming your way. I've been loving the ProSupps Mr. Hyde Signature Dual Tub because there's two different flavors, which you can also combine to make a third flavor. It's so enjoyable. It's a clean energy source and there's 200mg of caffeine, which means that you get a nice boost but you're not going to crash after. It was perfect for my morning Pilates and, ugh, I just feel so good after. You can find it at your local Costco.\"\n\nDelivery: The voiceover is delivered in a friendly, enthusiastic, and informative tone.

            "Your Product Message": "Product Name: MAX Pre-Workout Explosion\nProduct Category: Pre-Workout Supplement\n\nProduct Visual Description FOR SORA 2 CONSISTENCY:\n\nThe MAX Pre-Workout comes in a cylindrical matte-finish plastic container, approximately 16-20oz with roughly 4.5-inch diameter and 7-inch height. The entire container features a soft mint green (#A8D5BA) matte finish with a black ribbed screw-top lid. The product name \"MAX PRE-WORKOUT EXPLOSION\" appears in bold, uppercase, dark charcoal sans-serif typography on the upper-middle portion of the container, with a darker sage green (#6B8E6F) rectangular label panel beneath it containing the tagline \"Unleash Your Full Potential - Energy, Focus, Pump\" in smaller text. The flavor \"ELECTRIC LIME BURST\" is displayed in a white rounded rectangle badge. The oversized \"max\" logo dominates the lower third in chunky, lowercase dark charcoal letters. Five benefit icons with labels (Explosive Energy, Razor Focus, Raked Focus, Clinically Dosed, No Artificial Dyes/Sweeteners) run vertically down the right side of the label panel in black. When held, the container fits comfortably in one hand with fingers wrapped around the cylinder, typically displayed at chest to shoulder height with label facing camera.\n\n---\n\n### MESSAGING & BRAND VOICE\n\n**Primary Value Proposition:**\nMAX delivers maximum performance through clinically-dosed, transparent ingredients that actually work—no fillers, no proprietary blends, just pure results.\n\n**Key Benefits (Priority Order):**\n1. **Clinically-Dosed Ingredients** - Every ingredient is included at the research-backed effective dose, not under-dosed like most pre-workouts that hide behind proprietary blends\n2. **Complete Transparency** - Full label disclosure means you know exactly what you're putting in your body and why it works\n3. **Triple-Threat Performance** - Delivers explosive energy, razor-sharp focus, and maximum pump all in one formula\n4. **Clean Formula** - No artificial dyes or sweeteners that sabotage your health while claiming to boost performance\n\n**Unique Differentiators:**\n- Clinical dosing on every ingredient (not pixie-dusted amounts)\n- Zero proprietary blends—complete transparency\n- No artificial additives while still delivering on taste and performance\n- Formulated for actual results, not just stimulant buzz\n\n**Brand Voice Characteristics:**\n\nOverall Voice: MAX speaks with confident authority backed by science. The tone is bold and direct without being aggressive, appealing to serious athletes who want transparency and results over marketing hype. The brand communicates like a knowledgeable training partner who tells it straight—no sugar-coating, no BS, just effective information delivered with energy and conviction.\n\nTone Attributes:\n- **Confident & Direct** - Makes strong claims backed by science; doesn't hedge or use weak qualifiers like \"may help\" or \"could support\"\n- **Transparent & Educational** - Explains the \"why\" behind ingredients; treats customers as intelligent people who deserve full information\n- **Results-Focused** - Emphasizes tangible performance outcomes over vague promises; speaks in specifics not generalities\n\nLanguage Style:\n- Sentence structure: Mix of punchy short sentences for impact and slightly longer sentences for explanation; active voice dominates\n- Vocabulary level: Educated fitness enthusiast—uses terms like \"clinical doses,\" \"vasodilation,\" \"nootropic\" but explains them simply\n- Formality: Professional but conversational; authoritative without being academic or condescending\n- Use of slang/colloquialisms: Minimal—might use gym terms like \"pump\" or \"PR\" but avoids excessive bro-speak\n\nExample Phrases That Fit MAX Voice:\n- \"Every ingredient at clinical doses—not the fairy-dusted amounts you'll find in proprietary blends\"\n- \"You deserve to know exactly what's fueling your workout, which is why MAX shows you everything on the label\"\n- \"Explosive energy, laser focus, and maximum pump—all without the artificial junk\"\n\n**IMPORTANT NOTE ON VOICE:**\nThese voice characteristics define WHAT MAX says and WHICH WORDS they use. They do NOT override template delivery. If a template is high-energy and fast-paced, MAX's words will be delivered with high energy and fast pacing. The vocabulary changes, the delivery matches the template.\n\n**Target Audience:**\n- Demographics: Men and women ages 22-45, serious about fitness (train 4-6x per week), moderate to advanced lifters, CrossFit athletes, physique competitors\n- Pain Points: Tired of under-dosed pre-workouts that don't deliver results; frustrated by proprietary blends that hide what's actually in the product; concerned about artificial ingredients and long-term health; skeptical of marketing hype\n- Goals: Maximize every training session; achieve peak performance; make informed decisions about supplementation; get stronger, leaner, and more focused\n\n**Messaging Pillars:**\n\n1. **TRANSPARENCY WINS**: Complete ingredient disclosure with clinical doses clearly listed. No proprietary blends means no hiding inferior ingredients or under-dosing. You know exactly what you're getting and can verify it against research.\n\n2. **SCIENCE-BACKED PERFORMANCE**: Every ingredient included for a specific, research-validated reason at the dose shown to work in studies. Not random ingredients thrown together, but a calculated formula designed for explosive energy, razor focus, and maximum pump.\n\n3. **CLEAN EFFECTIVENESS**: Delivers extreme performance without artificial dyes, sweeteners, or unnecessary additives. Proves you don't need to compromise your health for results.\n\n4. **MAXIMUM RESULTS**: Targets all three pillars of pre-workout performance simultaneously—energy to train harder, focus to execute perfectly, and pump for maximum muscle engagement. Not just a stimulant bomb.\n\n**Call-to-Action Preferences:**\n- \"Try MAX risk-free at [website]\"\n- \"Check the label yourself at [website]\"\n- \"See the full formula at [website]\"\n- \"Use code [X] for 20% off your first order\"\n\n**Messaging to Avoid:**\n- Vague claims like \"supports energy\" or \"may enhance performance\" (be specific and direct)\n- Over-the-top bro-marketing (\"GET SWOLE BRO\" or excessive exclamation marks)\n- Making it sound complicated or overly scientific (educate but don't lecture)\n- Comparing directly to competitors by name\n- Health claims beyond performance (like \"prevents disease\" or medical benefits)\n",
